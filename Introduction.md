# Business to Business

## Overview

This guidance is relevant to all project stakeholders. We recommend reading it in its entirety at least once, even if you've already started your journey with Auth0. We provide a Project Planning Guide in PDF format, details about how to get started with each phase of the implementation process, and checklists to help you manage the tasks in each phase.

We provide planning guidance in PDF format that you can download and refer to for details about our recommended strategies.

## Multiple Organization Architecture (Multitenancy)

Many B2B platforms implement some form of isolation and/or branding for their customers' organization, and this can add complexity to any Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. If this applies to you, then we recommend you take some time to read through our guidance and best practice advice for this type of environment.

## Get Started

Customers using Auth0 for Business-to-Business (B2B) projects typically share a common set of goals and objectives, and in the sections that follow we'll focus on our real-world customer implementation experiences to help you deliver your solution efficiently.

## Best Practice

Auth0 provides recommendations and best practice suggestions in an ad hoc way throughout this guide in panels like this one. You can also obtain detailed guidance regarding specific functionality by speaking with your account representative or a member of our Auth0 Professional Services team.
